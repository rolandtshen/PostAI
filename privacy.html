    <h2>In China</h2>
    <p>In the past decade, the world has seen the immense expansion and advancement of surveillance technology. Applications of surveillance that were once solely depicted in science fiction are now regularly used around the globe. Every day, surveillance cameras capture the actions, habits, and even conversations of people all around the world. These cameras play a role in deterring crime, identifying criminals, and maintaining security. And now, with the development of quick and accurate facial recognition technology, surveillance cameras have become adept at identifying any person caught on camera. Although surveillance technology was initially created to enhance public safety and to promote security, it‚Äôs exponential growth has led to concerns regarding privacy and other potential abuses. The modern, camera filled world has transformed into a place where nothing will go unseen, and where it‚Äôs almost impossible to be truly private. Additionally, facial recognition technology brings with it a myriad of different exploitations of power as well; people are tracked everywhere they go, so such technology can be used to manipulate people into behaving in certain ways.
‚ÄúChina: Facial recognition and state control‚Äù is an episode of The Economist‚Äôs web-series Now & Next that addresses some of the abuses of facial recognition powered surveillance systems in China, the world leader in the development of facial recognition technology and the utilization of surveillance technology (Economist). The episode is formatted as a mini documentary that spans around 6 minutes in length. The short mini documentary form of the media, as well as its public visibility on YouTube makes it clear that accessibility and education are The Economist‚Äôs top priorities. Formatting the video as a 6 minute mini documentary makes it easy for viewers to consume and process the information presented. While it‚Äôs not an exceptionally detailed view of the issue, it provides enough context for viewers to understand the dangers of such technology. Furthermore, The Economist‚Äôs decision to publish the mini documentary completely free on YouTube makes it extremely accessible and open to a vast audience. Therefore, this mini-documentary excels at spreading awareness of the rising issue of the abuses of surveillance technology.
The video gives insight on some non-surveillance oriented practical applications of facial recognition technology already in use today. Then, it dives into the government‚Äôs plans to significantly expand their existing national surveillance system with facial recognition technology to ‚Äúcement its authoritarian rule‚Äù (Economist). With such a system, the government would be able to track everything that every citizen does. The video goes so far as to warn of the totalitarian state that could rise in response to the mass installation of CCTV cameras. Interviews from the video indicate that Chinese citizens are already fearing their complete loss of privacy, as well as the extreme power the state holds from using this technology. While the mini-documentary does show some benefits of facial recognition powered cameras, it mostly emphasizes China‚Äôs ability to exercise state control over the nation using surveillance technology ‚Äî a negative that outweighs the benefits. These elements of state control range from the public ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù of citizens who commit petty crimes like jaywalking to the mass subjugation of entire ethnic minority groups (Economist).
A technological and futuristic aesthetic was used in the documentary, incorporating a layer of science fiction inspired, hologram-like visuals to maintain the theme of futuristic tech throughout the video. Although not an accurate representation of how facial recognition cameras perceive the environment, this visual simulation of the camera‚Äôs perspective also allows viewers to better understand how the technology works, and more importantly, how advanced the surveillance technology already is. On the other hand, real life examples of facial recognition and surveillance cameras are also displayed in the mini documentary through CCTV camera feeds that can almost instantly identify every person on screen. This again reinforces the idea of how powerful the technology already is in the modern day. Additionally, many scenes of heavy police and military presence are included in the documentary. These scenes plant a recurring image of oppression and control by armed forces over regular civilians in viewers minds, which in turn sends a subconscious message of the dangers of such technology.
‚ÄúChina: facial recognition and state control‚Äù places much emphasis on the specific example of China‚Äôs striking use of surveillance technology to control the Uyghur population in the province of Xinjiang (Economist). The Uyghurs, a Muslim people of Turkic ethnicity, are a prime example of Benedict Anderson‚Äôs concept of imagined community. These people live in the same place, mostly follow the Islamic faith, and hold similar cultural practices. Though many of the Uyghurs have never met one another, they all share the same identity and find themselves to be part of that homogeneous, imagined community anyway. The Chinese province of Xinjiang is comprised mostly of Uyghurs who perceive themselves to be part of an exclusive imagined community ‚Äî one that does not include the rest of China. And because the Uyghurs differ in culture and values from the majority of China, the Chinese government seeks to maintain control over the Uyghurs because they pose a separatist threat stemming from their major ideological differences. The documentary portrays the massive abuse of surveillance technology in the Xinjiang region to control the Uyghur people, showing a heavy police presence and the restricted lives of the Uyghurs due to the constant state of surveillance imposed on them. The video clearly demonstrates the Chinese government‚Äôs exercise of state control through telling of an estimated one million Uyghurs being detained in internment camps, and the use of surveillance technology to keep the Uyghurs in line.
Steve Chao, author of AlJazeera article ‚ÄúExposed: China‚Äôs surveillance of Muslim Uighurs,‚Äù takes a deeper look into the colossal injustices that the Uyghur population faces as a result of these surveillance systems (Chao). The article is formatted in an interview style, features the stories of three Uyghurs who have previously been detained within these internment camps, dubbed by the Chinese government as ‚Äúreeducation centers.‚Äù Through hearing these Uyghurs‚Äô stories, it becomes clear the massive injustices and brutality that the Uyghurs face within the internment camps.
Also demonstrated in the article is the Chinese government‚Äôs bizarre intolerance for the Uyghur ethnicity and their culture. One could have "a long beard or some religious text on [their] phone, or maybe [one] studied abroad or had a long-distance phone call with someone overseas‚Äù (Chao) ‚Äî anything of the sort, no matter how trivial, could land someone in detention. What‚Äôs worse is that surveillance systems are always watching, giving the government full power to dictate over Xinjiang. The government claims that these reeducation centers were created to fix extremists‚Äô mentalities and to teach valuable skills; however, Chao reveals how absurdly wide the government‚Äôs definition of extremism has become. Actions as inconsequential as growing out a beard can lead to extensive, inhumane punishments.
The testimonial style of the article is powerful because it provides a variety of first person accounts of what the internment camps are like. By interviewing Amat, Ayup, and Jaliloua, Chao creates a medium to share their once silenced stories. Collectively, the interviews reveal the interrogations, beatings, rapes, and religious oppression that occur within the internment camps. The interviews also tell of the outrageous reasons why they were detained in the first place; in every case, they were punished due to, ironically, an extreme interpretation of extremism. This, in addition to showing the human stories behind the interviewees, creates a sympathetic response from readers. It promotes to readers how severe the issue is while also urging people to take a stand.
Chao also makes clear that these camps are much worse than what the government claims them to be. While the government claims the camps to be mere ‚Äúvoluntary vocational training facilities designed to provide job training and to stamp out extremist tendencies‚Äù (Chao), the interviews prove these claims are outright false. While the government is using surveillance technology to detain the Muslim population, they have been simultaneously projecting a false perception of their intentions to the rest of the world. The article, published on Jan. 31, 2019, is actually a recent revelation of what occurs inside the camps (Chao). Given that the internment camps first surfaced in 2014 in response to China‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs war on terror,‚Äù it is evident that the issue has not been discussed enough, as it has taken 5 years for the media to publicize what really occurs inside.
At the end of the day, the high-tech surveillance systems are what empower the Chinese government to commit this subjugation. The mass surveillance system is the tool used to identify Uyghur people and to catch them doing anything the government considers extremist. The existence and unfortunate success of these internment camps are proof of how dangerous surveillance technology can be, especially when used to exercise state control. Furthermore, the implementation of China‚Äôs plan to create a state of ‚Äúhyper surveillance‚Äù would only give the government even more tools to abuse and violate the rights of this ethnic minority. From examining the abuses on the Uyghur population, it‚Äôs clear that the abuse of surveillance technology is an issue that must be discussed more regarding its future implications, and an issue whose
	While surveillance technology does hold benefits like the deterrence of crime and evidence for law enforcement, such powerful technology concurrently faces the potential of human rights violations, especially when used on a large scale. ‚ÄúChina: facial recognition and state control‚Äù provides clear insight into what a society looks like under facial recognition powered cameras, and the human rights that could be easily violated through such a comprehensive surveillance system. The Uyghur population in Xinjiang is a clear victim of such human rights violations, currently suffering through massive internment camp programs enabled by dictatorial state control stemming from surveillance technology. Through the video‚Äôs short documentary form and its availability on YouTube, the issue is spread in a concise and accessible way. The documentary‚Äôs futuristic theme and constant screening of oppressed populations also suggest the ubiquity of state control and totalitarianism. The mini documentary is important and impactful because it emphasizes that a state of hyper surveillance is no longer science fiction or a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù situation. Surveillance technology is a double edged sword ‚Äî it has tremendous potential to be used productively, but also huge risks of being nefariously exploited. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs mission, including yours, to shape the usage of this technology the right way.
